## A simple method for identifying transcription factor mediated regulatory networks from scRNA and scATAC data

### Dependencies

Docker (link) - an independent container platform

### Workflow

Taking a sce object for both scRNA and scATAC

### Workflow Method
TBD
### Deliverables

A workflow that outputs a table containing a ranked transcription factor mediated network and an easy to use interactive visualization platform of the gene regulatory networks.

### Installation
